# **App Name**: Concept Navigator

## Core Features:

- Topic Input Bar: Provides a central text input for users to define their topic.
- AI Content Generation: Generates definitions and explanations for any node the user specifies using the What, How, When, Explain, and Expand tool.
- Infinite Pannable Canvas: An infinite canvas allows for limitless panning and exploration, enabling a dynamic expansion of thought.
- Dynamic Connector Lines: Automatically create a connector line from a parent node to a child node. When a node is created by the AI from an existing node, this visually establishes a parent-child relationship.
- YouTube Video Integration: Users can add YouTube videos as nodes to the concept map using links, allowing for easy integration of visual learning resources.
- Toolbox Panel: Display buttons for ai powered action, plus a distinct "Enter Yours" button, that has input to enable freeform question formulation

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft blue (#64B5F6) to promote calmness and focus.
- Background color: Very light blue (#E3F2FD), a desaturated variant of the primary.
- Accent color: Light green (#81C784) for a contrasting color.
- Font: 'Inter' sans-serif, for all UI elements in the app. This font provides a clean and modern appearance suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Use rounded rectangles and soft drop shadows for nodes and buttons to give the interface a modern, approachable feel.
- Incorporate subtle transition animations when creating new nodes, and expanding the concept canvas to make the experience fluid and responsive.
- Use minimalist icons within the Toolbox Panel, specifically adhering to the flat design principle to maintain a clean and focused user experience.
